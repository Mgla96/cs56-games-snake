a.
It is a single/multi-player original snake game. The difficulty changes the speed of your snake. When you eat the "food", your snake becomes longer. If you touch your tail, you "died" and the tail length returns to default length.

b.
As a user I can set the difficulty so that the snake moves faster.
As a user I can set the background to puddles so that there are puddles decoration in the background as the game runs.
As a user I can control the snake with the arrow keys so that the snake changes directions.
As a snake I can eat food so that I can grow longer.
As a snake I can touch my own tail so that I can kill myself.
As a snake I can touch another snakes tail to kill myself in multiplayer mode.

c.
It does run by inputing "ant run". A window shows up displaying the main menu, with options of numbers of players, difficulties, and game mode options.

d.
As a snake I hope I can encounter special food so that there will be special effect to enhance the snake's ability to survive in multiplayer mode.
A a user I hope I can adjust the difficulty to grow tail my tail faster everytime I eat a food so that there will be more diversed gameplay.
As a user I hope I can get a bigger gameplay screen so that more players can join in a game.

e.
There should sections grouping similar ideas. Maybe different headers for each game mode and their controls. A setup section that describes where each of the files required for this game should be.
Instructions to run the game is not clear.

f.
There are no targets that needed adjustments on their comments.

g.
If the snake travels outside of the gameplay screen and change to horizontal direction, it will not show on the gameplay screen.
The food doesn't always align with the head of the snake.

Note: A mentor added the same issues we discovered a day before so we cannot add them to the issues page.

i.
Some of the code can be commented. More classes can be made so that the work is easier to be read. Overall the code is pretty orgranized and good spacing with comments on each method, especially in the SnakeFrame.java file. The methods inside GameObject.java is very unclear because they lack comments on the purpose of the variables. Painter.java seems completely pointless because everything is commented out. The java files inside the snake folder have names that clearly display how the object files work together. It's easy to read and not difficult to understand because the code has nice spacing and organization with some comments in some java files. If I had to give someone else that was going to work on the code just “one screenful of text” to help that programmer get up to speed quickly,I will explain connections between the java files in the snake folder, and what the objects are created by, and what they do in terms of gameplay.

j.
There is only one test that tests the tail's location and its get functions. There are junit tests. Most of the project should be covered by testing. There are opportunities to expand test coverage. We can test the collision scenerio of two snakes, the location of the food, setting a high score, the snake's location. We can also do testing for multiple inputs at one time, and invalid inputs.
