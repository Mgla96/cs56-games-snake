##### Description: This is a game where the user controls a 'snake' on the screen, using the arrow keys. The objective is to move the 'snake' around to capture the red dot (fruit), which subsequently tallies points.

##### As a user I can move the snake around so that I can get the fruit
##### As a user I can pause the current game so that I can take a snack break

##### The software does run. It currently allows you to play the game in a very simple way. It also allows you to pause the game.

##### As a user I can level my snake up to move faster so that the game can be more challenging
##### As a user I can get special temporary fruits, that give me more points than the basic fruit
##### As a user I can change the game mode to include side walls to avoid, making the game more difficult

##### The README seems to contain all of the information that the user needs, however, not much information detailing the architecture for the programmer.

##### The build.xml file is very clear.

##### There are a lot of issues, so it shouldn't be difficult to get up to 1000 points. They are mostly clear on what the expectations are. In some cases they issues are more creative enhancements with flexibility in implementations.

##### The code is well organized. There is an inheritence structure that makes handling a lot of the issues simple, because it provides the flexibility to write our own classes from scratch. There are very few methods in any given class, so that makes readability fairly simple. The names of the classes are self explanatory, and no single class has much code, so diving right in will be straightforward. If I had one piece of advice, it would be to understand inheritence, and understand the inheritence structure of this program. Everything else will be simple.

##### There is only one test file, so there can definitely be additional testing written. In terms of overall coverage, there isn't much code to begin with, so there isn't a lot to cover, however, there are a few missing pieces such as test cases covering the fruit that don't exist.
