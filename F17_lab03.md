(a) A replicate of the Snake game. Player ,ameuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obsta\
cle.

(b)..*As an user, I can go to the menu and change the color of my snake, so that I can make my snake lovely.
   ..*As an user, I can go to the menu and change the color of the panel, so that I don't get bored of the game.
   ..*As an user, I can go to the menu and restart the game, so that I can stop the current game and start another one.

(c)The program runs successfully. First, the game asks how many players are playing, size of the map, and the difficulty. Th\
en user can hit the space bar to start the game. Users nevigate the snakes using arrow keys. Game restarts when snakes hit e\
ach other.

(d)..*As an user, I can change the background of my panel, so that it looks more aesthetic.
   ..*As an user, I can choose what kind of snake I want to play with, so that it is more fun.
   ..*As an user, I can choose the length of the snake at the beginning of the game, so that I don't have to build up my sna\
ke.
   ..*As an user, I can choose what kind of fruits is given

(e)We can add headers to README.md such as: "How to run the game?", "Tech stack", "Game modes"... to make it more formatted \
and easy to read.

(f)There are no targets that need descriptions. (come back later)

(g)Yes, there are enough issues. Yes, the issues are clear in terms of what the expectations are.

(h)..*Make the size of the fruits bigger than the snake.

(i)We think that the code is very organized. We see a clear structure of the program from GameObject all to way to small components of the game such as BasicFruit. Good use of inheritance. The purposes of the classes and their methods are very clear. Because of the good use of inheritance, the code for methods in the classes are clear and concise which has high readibility. THe names of the classes are intuitive and self-explanatory. One screenful of text we would give will probably be to run the game and figure out how exactly the game works becasue it is easier to understand the code with a deep understanding of the functionality of the game. 

(j)There is only one test file named TailTest and it only tests the Tail component of the game.There are multiple JUnit tests in the file and they cover every method in the Tail class. There is definitely opportunity to expand the test coverage becasue there are so many different elements in the game such as snake, fruit...
